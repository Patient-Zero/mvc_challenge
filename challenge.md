MVC is a type of structre of a system that separates application logic from the rest of the user interface. It does this by separating the application into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller. 

The model contains the data of the application and how the application generally functions. It stores information, can respond to requests for information, respond to instructions to add or update information etc. This could be a database, or any number of data structures or storage systems. It is the data and data-management section of the application. 

The view is all about user interface. It displays all the data from the model generally in pages or some other suitable medium for the user to be able to interact with in a meningful way. 

The controller takes in inputs from the user and makes calls to model objects and the view to perform appropriate actions.

These three components comprise the MVC model.
